VERSE 1

I don’t want to
Always tell you
These words are sharp
Break me like a knifes

You don't even ask me why
What went wrong then
On Sundays always by my side
But you're gone now

CHORUS

Don’t tell me
You're sorry
Talking is now overrated

Just show me
You want me
Our life is ephemeral

Don’t tell, I know your love
Is everlasting

Just show me 
You love me
I don't want to let it go

VERSE 2

I don’t want to always talk
But I have to 
I just want to hug you now
Not goodbye

Every whisper, every sigh
You say sorry,
Thoughts of you are on my mind
Never ending

I can’t believe we’re drifting, fading,
Used to love, now hesitating,
What’s the reason? Why we're waiting?
Lost in time, it’s so frustrating.

Used to laugh, now we fight,
Late at night, I’m losing sight, 
All these questions got no replies,
I’m searching for answers in your eyes.

BRIDGE

Always
Sorry
Never
Talking
Standing still and
I have been waiting
