Verse1

When did it all fall apart? / When did all fall apart?
Did you try to change me?
Guess its all my fault
And you are the angel.

You moved on so quickly
Did you ever love me?
it was so easy for you. / it was only for you
Iâ€™m still trying to heal / I am still trying to heal

Chorus

Far away
I went far away
Far away
I went far away from you.

Go away
Just give me a break
Go away
I want to break free from you.    

Verse2
Saved all your pictures,
All your messages, 
Since the day I met you 
I just like your face.

We are getting closer
to be strangers soon,
I don't feel like
I want to see you anymore.
